This is an application that was created during my Summer 2020 Intro to Programming class. This application allow player to answers questions about
strawberry and try to recived points.

# Assignment Challenge(s)
The challenge for this assignment was to figure out what questions to include in my application. However, the big issue was figuring how to add codes to allow players to receive points. To solve my first issue, I went on google to search for fun facts about strawberries. Then to address my most significant concern regarding code for the points, I decided to went on GitHub or other programming platforms to help me with my issue. I also had to figure out how I would incorporate the codes and cite the codes correctly.
